# Milestone 1 : Web Scrapping

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. It is available for Python 2.7 and Python 3.

# Milestone 2 : Data Warehouse

The Apache Hive â„¢ data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. Structure can be projected onto data already in storage. A command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to Hive.

* Configuration in video:
	* Hadoop (2.10.0)
	* Debry (10.14.2.0)
	* Hive (2.1.0)

# Milestone 4 : Data Interpretation

Data Interpretation is the process of making sense out of a collection of data that has been processed. In this part, I continued the work from Milestone 3 and visualized the sentiment analysis results. Then, I performed data modeling process and compared the performance metrics of each machine leanring algorithm.
